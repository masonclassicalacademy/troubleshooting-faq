## Documentation

This site is meant to be an assist to our daily operations and troubleshooting that we perform. In addition, if there are tasks, i.e., upgrading servers or configuring out networks, setup of a new campus, etc., this will be a place to document things that really aren't manual-related information. This way, if people are out, new, or unreachable, we have a common starting point to give outsiders and new people alike a fighting chance at keeping our schools operational, from an IT perspective.

To learn about the site setup, configuration, and maintenance please checkout the contriubting section.


## How Markdown Works
This site is run by a markup language called, Markdown. This is a brief overview of how the markup language works for this site. Feel free to Google for more thorough documentaiton.
Hugo supports [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax for formatting text, creating lists, and more. This page will show you some of the most common Markdown syntax examples.
