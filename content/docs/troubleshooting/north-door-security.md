## Background
 At times the door security system doesn't work properly- possibly due to something tied to our network. The main thing is if it isn't working properly, there are a few things we can do to troubleshoot.
 
 ## Door System Down
 If the door system is not functioning properly- especially if Ms. Case's ability to let people in through the computer is not working, then here are some basic steps you can take to resolve quickly (hopefully):


### Reset Power
The power supply for the doors system is located in the front lobby behind the desk - and there is a large AC adapter that can be reset. If any of the front lobby secretaries are there, they may be seeing black screens, or unable to let visitors in through the system.

The AC Adapter and the backup power supply sits behind the front lobby desk directly behind where Ms. Case is located. Unplugging the adapter or cord to the power supply for 10-15 seconds and plugging it back in should work.

 ### Validate Panel
 It might be good to validate the panel if the first step doesn't work. The panel for the doors is located in the southeast server room on floor 1. When you walk in the door, it is the panel that is enclosed between the two servers, directly against the wall. It has the motherboard, and the internet connection and cables are seated into the motherboard within the panel.

## Resetting

Simply unplugging and waiting 10-15 seconds and plugging back in might fix some issues related to connectivity, and will attempt to reset the doors system. It is a good first idea to troubleshooting basic issues. Then going to the panel in the workroom
