## Background
Paper and toner consumption is a major expense for the school, so we ask teachers to do your best to keep the volume of printing low.  Here are some helpful tips we spread to them:

* Make a single copy on your classroom printer and use the high volume photocopiers to make additional copies for distribution.  Photocopiers are more cost effective for higher volumes than printers.

* Utilize the print preview to double-check before you print.  There’s a good chance you’ll catch your mistakes then before you use up paper.

* Print on both sides of the page.  This halves the paper consumption.  

* Use the “draft” print mode instead of “normal” whenever possible.  This cuts down on toner/ink consumption.


## Common issues
The most common printer issues are paper jams, toner depletion, and “hung” documents. 

### Jams
Paper Jams: open up the printer drawers and lids and carefully remove and visible paper.  Also check the paper tray and under the toner cartridge.

### Toner depletion
Toner cartridges are expensive.  Please try to use every last bit of toner in the cartridge.  Their life can sometimes be extended somewhat by removing the cartridge, giving it a few shakes, and putting it back in the printer.  If nothing more can be printed, please check the cabinets in the workroom for new toner cartridge.  These come in both color and black ink, so make sure you're aware which one is the issue.


### Stuck Documents
Sometimes a document won’t print and will be “stuck” in the system somewhere.  Try double-clicking on the printer icon at the bottom right hand corner of your monitor to “See what’s printing”.  From here you can often delete a hung document.  If that doesn’t work, try turning your printer off and on again.  If that doesn’t work, turn your printer off again, reboot your computer, and then turn your printer on again.

### Status Errors
Most of our copiers have status indicators for many parts within the copier. Be aware they will show up on the touch screen. When logging in, you can see details of the notification, which at times may require attention and immediate action, contacting a copier representative, or ordering new supplies ourselves.

### Staple Refills
We do have an account with Canon and they re-order supplies for us automatically for a lot of the items within the copy machines, however this doesn't include staples. Staples need to be placed in orders initiated by us, so be aware.
