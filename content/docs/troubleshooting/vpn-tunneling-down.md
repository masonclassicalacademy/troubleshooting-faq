## Background
There are times where we periodically (~2 weeks) see VPN tunneling between routers on the campuses cause issues. The most common thing to do is to reset the routers.

## North Campus
On the north campus, we have the Summit Broadbrand Fiber coming into the 2nd floor server room, near the drum room and Mr. Hull’s office. [insert picture here of the room and the fiber setup and routers]

The router is the smaller black box 2nd from  top and can be recycled/reset by unplugging the back of the router. The Summit Fiber’s  in and out  cords are tagged and sitting beneath the router a few boxes, as seen here in the picture.

## Common Symptoms
Common symptoms when there is lost VPN tunneling is DNS issues and printers not being able to communicate or function properly. This has been investigated multiple times and significant efforts to find a root cause, but not apparent issues have been discovered.
