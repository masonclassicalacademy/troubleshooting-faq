## Introduction

This site is meant to be an assist to our daily operations and troubleshooting that we perform. In addition, if there are tasks, i.e., upgrading servers or configuring out networks, setup of a new campus, etc., this will be a place to document things that really aren't manual-related information. This way, if people are out, new, or unreachable, we have a common starting point to give outsiders and new people alike a fighting chance at keeping our schools operational, from an IT perspective.

To learn about the site setup, configuration, and maintenance please checkout the contributing section.
