## Introduction

When there are teachers, administration staff, or others associated with Mason Classical that leave, resign, or otherwise no longer are associated with MCA, we need to process this and ensure accesses are updated and equipment is returned.


# Updates
* Remove the staff member from the [website](https://masonacademy.com/apps/staff/)
* [Remove or add door accesses](/docs/how-to/door-security.md) as necessary. This should mean deleting the user from the linear system. Documentation on the linear security door system in located in our [IT manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FTnrAtKRgohreLQcMQWQcB9kovXHajtX/edit#heading=h.ar0p36vrx7vw). It contains all the necessary login, and steps there to remove (or add) staff members to the door security system.
* Validate if person was listed on the Wix website `mca-gymnasium.com` too.
* Update [Gradicus](http://[school](https://gradicus.schoolclassics.org/)) website.
