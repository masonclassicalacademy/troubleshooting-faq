## MCA Public Website

There is no current procedure or process/overhead for making changes to the website live. They are administered through the web mgmt software and is setup like a wordpress. There is no HTML that I am aware of, and it requires very little knowledge to make changes.

### Admin
[Login link to our .com](https://admin.masonclassicalacademy.org/cgi-bin2/login.ssp)

This has its own user bank and is not tied to our mca domain. Mr. Steer setup an admin account for me separately.

### Visibility
They use an active/inactive model for 'live' web pages on the actual site and the settings is available in the properties of the web gui adminsistration panel.

## Organization
Most of the site pages are listed on the left-nav "Extra Sections". There is general organization and minimal correlation to the actual navigation or folder structure. (Needs improvement)

## Other common edit items:
- Forms (you can copy forms from previous years and edit titles, etc.)
- Staff (you can organize our staff information)
- [Facilities schedule](https://admin.masonclassicalacademy.org/apps/facilities/admin/index.jsp). This allows users to see what events are taking place within MCA.
  - We also store the campus carts of chromebooks in this section. We have them labeled like:
    - NC - Cart#03 (2nd Floor Lobby). This stands for North Campus. There is a reservations section to the facilities page that allows teachers to reserve carts for their students.
