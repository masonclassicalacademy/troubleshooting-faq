## Background
IXL is a vendor-based testing solution teachers use at Mason to help students prepare and get extra exercise in academics.

## Teacher setup 
Every teacher is created a login when they are hired. This means the to access IXL, as a teacher, they need to:
- # Login to IXL as themself
   * We use the same user name as your email (first initial last name) followed by @mca1.
   *  Or if you go to this page, the last bit is prefilled for you: `https://www.ixl.com/signin/mca1`

* If they don’t remember their password, click on the “Forgot Password” link and follow the directions.

* Once they are in, look for the link for “Roster” across the top.  Here they can add students.  

* Click on “+ Add students”.  Click in one of the fields (i.e. last name or first name) and start typing to trigger autocompletion and make selections.

* To view how the students in a roster are doing, click on “Analytics” at the top.
