## Background
We use Google Drive for storing all documents/files.  Store your school files/documents here rather than in your computer’s documents folder or desktop.  

## Access
`Use the same login information as your email account.`  

As with the email, you can access your documents two ways:
* Through the browser by logging in as above and clicking on the apps icon at the top right of the Google page, then selecting Drive.
* Through the Google Drive for Desktop app on your computer.  This synchronizes a location on your local computer’s hard drive and your online storage location.  You can access your files like any other file or folder from any computer you have with Google Drive installed on it.  This is a great way to transfer files between work and home.  
* Download and install Google Drive for Desktop by going to Drive in your Chrome browser and by clicking on the gear at the top right or going to this [link](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379). 


## Hints & Tips
Using Google Drive for Desktop is good because it will Word documents open as Word documents rather than as a Google Doc when opening from the browser.  The same goes for Excel, etc.

 Not only does this serve as a backup for your documents, but it will also allow you to access your documents from anywhere in the world.  

* Do *NOT* create any Shared Drives.  Use those in existence, or if you need access to one, please contact the IT Department.

It is no longer recommended to share your folders with your colleagues.  It is better to use a Google “Shared Drive” for your team.  Please see the IT Director if you need to be added to a drive or need to have one created.

## Sharing Documents/Resources
You can (but see below) also share your folders with other people to share resources and to collaborate with planning, etc.  

`**Note**:` 
Other people can also alter or delete your files if you share with them.  Thus, if you have anything important, you may want to keep separate copies in a folder that is not shared.  Go to Google Drive in your browser to select sharing options (#1 above).
